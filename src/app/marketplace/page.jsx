          Stowave is sold directly through our own website only. We don't

          anyone else to sell on our behalf.

        <p>
          Prices, sizing, and stock shown anywhere other than our own site
          can be outdated or incorrect. Orders placed outside stowave.com
          also fall outside our return policy, since we have no way to
          verify what was actually paid or shipped.

      <Section number={3} title="Spot something suspicious?">
        <p>
          If you come across a page or seller claiming to be Stowave
          somewhere other than our own site, let us know — we'd rather
          hear about it early than have someone get a shirt that isn't
          actually ours.
